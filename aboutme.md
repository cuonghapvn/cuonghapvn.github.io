<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2019**   Internal Self Service Portal

I spent the second half of the year creating a single-page application based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for visualizing product changelog and configuration details.
Therefore I had to relearn javaScript and started working with the [materialize-css](https://materializecss.com/) framework and other well known node modules.

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2019**   Release Management Tool MkII

First part of the year I was focused on expanding the Release Management tools and workflows for our cloud hosted applications:

* Added automated aggregation of release details for each hosted application.
* Added changelog workflow for documenting releases.
* Defined rollout life cycle states for each new release.
* ITIL compliant syncing of the release data into centralized CMDB.

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2018**   KIVBF merged with its partners to form ITEOS in order to be able to offer uniform services. After adjusting the internal organizational structure, I'm now part of the business unit 4.2 _(Integration-, Security- & Application Managent)_.
My previous team was reassigned to this new unit as well, and was renamed into CAFS _(Cloud- & Application-Frontend-Services)_.
So my range of tasks changed slightly.

#### <i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> 2012 - 2018 <i class="fa fa-building-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> [KIVBF](https://www.kivbf.de) as **SysOp** / **DevOps Engineer**

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2015**   In 2015 I started automating several platform and workload
related use cases. Unfortunately it's closed source, so I can't talk about details. But to give a glimpse at the
underlining technologies I can notice they were based on **Microsoft**, **VMware** and **Citrix** products.

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2014**   As the automation team got bigger and bigger, we needed to define
standards. That's why I began using [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/) as a developer framework in
combination with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to build our modules. This enabled us doing code review, lint tests,
unit test and building our own CI Environment.

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2013**   I joined into a new team which was building our new cloud
infrastructure. We purposed to offer our customers IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and EaaS services. My focus shifted
to automation and cloud orchestration. Back then I started using Powershell.

<i class="fa fa-calendar-plus-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **2012**   I needed to get away from those wacky enterprise applications
which were used in the public sector. So I took the chance to work in much bigger datacenter at
[KIVBF](https://www.kivbf.de). There I ran the backup and restore solution called IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM).

It was a great place to get to know such large environment and I finally started automating again. At this time I
implemented the monitoring system [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com/). Unfortunately I couldn't find any extension to
monitor out IBM tape library or TSM data itself. So I developed own interfaces therefore.

At the municipal administration of Pforzheim I was responsible for the**Software Packaging and Deployment**,
**MS-SQL Servers** and **Web Hosting**. -->
